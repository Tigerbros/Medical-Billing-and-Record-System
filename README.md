# Medical-Billing-and-Record-System
## Overview

This system is intended to digitize the medical billing and visit record process for students after they access services at the Covenant University Health Centre. It will allow students to log into their portal and view a detailed breakdown of their medical visits, prescriptions, procedures, and the associated billing information.

## Objectives

1. **Enhance billing transparency** so that all charges are clear and easily traceable.
2. **Reduce billing disputes** by giving students accurate, real-time access to their health-service charges.
3. **Enable better financial planning for students** through timely visibility of upcoming and past medical expenses.
4. **Improve health-service accountability** within the university by tracking services rendered against recorded charges.
5. **Increase administrative efficiency** by streamlining record-keeping and billing workflows for university staff.
6. **Protect student privacy** by ensuring that each student’s medical records and billing history are accessible only to that student.
